1.02   2015-06-13
	- No functional changes
	- Release tests moved to xt/

1.01   2012-02-12
	- New constructor parameters: border_width, grid, grid_width,
	  moon_dark, moon_light, & shade_color
	- The shade methods can now take options to customize the color.
	  This will generate code that requires PostScript level 2.
	- PostScript::Calendar objects can now be passed to PostScript::Convert
	- Use the function library provided by PostScript::File 2.20
	- All comments are stripped from the generated PostScript

1.00   2010-11-11
	- No functional changes
	- Restart test if necessary to pick up timezone change (Windows)

0.06   2010-09-27
	- Add a Creator comment only if we create the PostScript::File object
	- Document that passing ps_file => undef creates a new object
	- List the fonts we use even when given a ps_file
	- Force timezone in tests for consistent results
	- Figured out how to avoid Latin-1 in POD (S<C<< >>> works correctly)

0.05   2010-03-15
	- PostScript::File 2.00 now provides pstr and metrics
	  Font::AFM is no longer required!
	  This makes it much easier to get PostScript::Calendar working.
	- Now possible to include multiple calendars in one PostScript file
	  See example/calendar.pl for one way to do that.
	- The ps_file method actually works now
	- Switch to Dist::Zilla for packaging
